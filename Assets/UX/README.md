User eXperience kit helps you gather rich game data in a well formatted log, and then feed that data from within your game tools such as Trello, Zendesk, Unity's User Reporting, etc. and to help you capture and save screenshots for the full screen or sections of the screen.

### [Scene Tools](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/core-concepts/scenes-management)
The Scenes object helps you manage multi-scene, additive scene game architecture patterns. Multi-scene and additive scene paradigms can significantly improve performance and give you the developer a lot more flexibility in terms of design and architecture decisions; that is it allows you to group your scenes with respect to your games use as opposed to a single scene system where each scene exists on its own in isolation, and as a result must be a large monolithic structure which is slow to load and cumbersome to manage.

### [Selection System](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/core-concepts/selection-system)
UX provides an easy to use, flexable, searchable multi-select system. Read more about the API.Selection interface in its API article.

### [Tooltip System](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/core-concepts/tooltips)
The UX Tooltip tools are a simple and flexible approach to driving tooltips in your game. In the simplest form the tool can be thought of as a simple trigger that responds to mouse over event and provides basic feedback to use as a developer, e.g. an event you can listen on an the ability to control delays and similar.

By combining this simple concept with existing tools you can create any sort of tooltip your game may require. From simple popup messages (classic tooltips) to interactive tips with cascading tips contained with in.

### [Window System](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/core-concepts/window-tools)
The Window system makes it easy to define drag-able, re-sizable and dock-able windows in your game. The simple system can be attached to any Rect Transform and supports all canvas modes and all anchoring types. Window groups can be defined easily by simply parenting them in there own Rect Transforms where windows focus (move to top) and clamp (remain in frame) according to there parent.
