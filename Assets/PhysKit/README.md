## Description
PhysKit is a collection of battle tested physics system and tools to help you do more.

### Ballistics
Calculate the trajectory of projectiles quickly and efficiently with complete control over arc height, ground speed, launch velocity and more, and of course its all physically simulated.

### Buoyancy
Make it float with easy-to-use tools to calculate the buoyancy force on a rigid body, modify drag based on floating conditions and more! Our buoyancy tools can be easily hooked up to just about any ocean/water simulation tool.

### Force Effects
A powerful tool chain that can be used to create magnets, localized gravity, spherical gravity, dampening fields and so much more! Everything is configurable and highly extensible.

### Verlet Spring
Also called a "Dynamic Bone" or "Physics Bone" or "Swing Bone" Heathen's Verlet integration however can be applied to any transform and supports collision detection and back propigation of force effects along the higharchy. Integrate physics driven motion through a chain of transforms with a fast and easy to use Verlet integration. Make hair sway, props bounce, simulate softbody like behaviour (jiggle and bounce), ropes, chains and so much more!

## Samples and Extras
### Breakable Wood Props
A collection of props that work with the Breakable and IDestroy features of the PhysKit asset. Note that these assets import using the default Unity material. This is done to insure compatability with all rendering piplines without bloating the install. You can download and install Built-In, URP or HDRP materials free.
