## Description
UX uGUI Extras is a collection of uGUI extensions and tools to help you deliver on common needs not provided by Unity's own uGUI tools.

### [Key Collection](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/ugui-extras/key-collection)
Lets you create keyboards, pin pads, alien computer consoles or really any collection of "keys" as a simple Unity UI object.

### [Ligature Tools](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/ugui-extras/ligature-tools)
Define character combinations and the result character enabling Key Collection inputs for Korean, Japanese and other ligature based character sets as well as common use extended characters such as translating ( c ) to Â©

### [Tree View Collection](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/assets/ux/learning/ugui-extras/tree-view)
The tree view is a common GUI element that Unity simply lacks and isn't trivial to create from scratch. The Tree View Collection componenet simplifies this and makes it easy to manage tree views by expressing the data of the collection as GameObjects in your scene hierarchy.
